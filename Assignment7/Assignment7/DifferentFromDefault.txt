In this file we will detail the changes to the application that are different from the base template that was created.

Over time we will be able to delete the premade parts of the application but for now we will keep the structure.

If you have any questions feel free to message me on Canvas but you'll probably reach me faster on Discord | FireBot #0187

I have made the Database in Azure Cloud using SQL Server, which you should all be able to connect to now, just "Add SQL Server" in Sql Server Object Explorer



I already did the dotnet ef database update so it will have all of the identity tables that are built in with
the authentication option we chose when creating the Application which uses the Identity Framework.


When using any migration we will have to specify the DbContext ~~~ dotnet ef migrations add [MigrationName] --context [ApplicationDbContext] OR [AppIdentityDbContext] -o Data/[ApplicationDbMigrations] OR [AppIdentityDbMigrations]
Renamed the initial ApplicationDbContext to the IdentityDbContext and turned the ApplicationDbContext into our entity framework context.

Added a Listing class that has been migrated to our database (you will find this as a table in the User database. I don't know why I thought it was making two databases. But yes we will be able to
relate the Identity database and our Entity database by the UserName field, further updates to the class will require new migrations. Only needed if we change class members (not dataannotations)
