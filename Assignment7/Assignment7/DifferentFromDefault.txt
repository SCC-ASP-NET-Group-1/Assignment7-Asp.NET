In this file we will detail the changes to the application that are different from the base model that was created.

Over time we will be able to delete the premade parts of the application but for now we will keep the structure.

If you have any questions feel free to message me on Canvas but you'll probably reach me faster on Discord | FireBot #0187

I have made the Database in Azure Cloud using SQL Server, which you should all be able to connect to now, just "Add SQL Server" in Sql Server Object Explorer

SQL Azure Logon:
Server Name: aspnetgaragesale.database.windows.net
User: GarageSaleAdmin
Password: GarageSale#
Database Name: Users

I already did the dotnet ef database update so it will have all of the identity tables that are built in with
the authentication option we chose when creating the Application which uses the Identity Framework.

I'll be adding in the ApplicationDBContext for the Entity framework so we can add our listing table, but it will work on the cloud as well
